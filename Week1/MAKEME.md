## Homework week 1:

## Before you start with the homework:

1. Watch: [What is programming](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/intro-to-programming/v/programming-intro) Just watch the 2 min video, __you do not__ have to do the entire JavaScript course (It could be useful later on though). 

## Step 1: **Some freeCodeCamp challenges (10 hours):**

On freeCodeCamp.com please do the [Basic JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/map) exercises up and until the __"Shopping List"__ exercise (there are some topics we did not cover but you can do it).

## Step 2: JavaScript

> For all the following exercises create a new .js file. Try to find a proper name for each file or make a small comment about what it does inside for future reference

1. Declare a variable `x` and initialize it with an integer.

2. How do you round the number 7.25, to the nearest whole number?

3. Create a array called `colors` with the strings red, green and blue inside.

4. How can you find the length of the object you just created?

5. Write a program that checks the types of two variables and prints out `SAME TYPE` if they are the same type. 
For example: 
    
    let x = 9;
    let y = 'Hello';

    if () {
      console.log('SAME TYPE');
    }


6. If `x` equals 7, and the only other statement is `x = x % 3`, what would be the new value of `x`?

### How to hand in Homework:
```
How to hand in your homework:
• Upload your homework in your "sha-javascript1" Github repository. Make sure to create a new folder "week1" first. 
• Upload your homework files inside the week1 folder and write a description for this “commit”.
• Your sha-javascript1/week1 should now contain all your homework files.
• Place the link to your repository folder in Trello.
