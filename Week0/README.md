In week one we will discuss the following topics:

```

### Here are resources that we like you to read as a preparation for the coming lecture:

- Read this ~ http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch01.html read up to and including the *Strings* chapter (it’s okay if you don’t understand all of it yet, we will cover these concepts in class as well. Do make sure to write or document the questions you have so we can discuss them in class)

- Read the entire JavaScript Introduction at MDN~ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction

- Helpful resource: http://jsbooks.revolunet.com/ (here you can find tons of free JavaScript books online)
